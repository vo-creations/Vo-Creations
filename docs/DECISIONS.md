# DECISIONS — vocreations.com

Past-tense log of non-obvious calls: **why** something is the way it is, and what
changed. Append-only. Each entry has a `topic` key and a date.

**Reading rule:** the **latest entry on a `topic` wins.** A newer entry on the
same topic supersedes older ones (recency decides) — you do not need to find and
edit the old entry. For present-tense "how it works now," see
[SITE.md](SITE.md); this file is only the why/history.

## topic: payments — _2026-06_

Removed the website checkout (`app/mentorship/enroll/` page and `app/api/checkout/`
route) and the Google Sheets logging in the Stripe webhook (`logToSheet`,
`GOOGLE_SHEET_WEBHOOK`).

**Why:** mentorship is no longer sold through the website — sales go via direct
Stripe payment links sent to buyers. Payment visibility is handled by Slack
notifications alone, so the Sheets path and the on-site checkout were dead weight.
The webhook (`app/api/stripe-webhook/route.js`) stays, posting to Slack only.
`STRIPE_PRICE_FULL` / `STRIPE_PRICE_PLAN` / `GOOGLE_SHEET_WEBHOOK` are now unused
in Vercel (safe to delete).

## topic: marketing-2026-06 — _2026-06_

Shipped a marketing refresh. Supersedes the previous framing.

- **Guarantee** (homepage): now "1,000,000 organic views minimum, or 50% of your
  fee back" — replaces the old "3M+ view baselines" language. (Note: `/creators`
  still references "3M+"; left as-is, not yet reconciled.)
- **Mentorship:** reframed as a 4-month path toward $10–15K/month, replacing the
  old "two months / $3–5K" framing.
- **New routes:** `/daniel`, `/danny`, `/thienvu` (conference/QR landings,
  `noindex`, standalone — no Nav/Footer), plus `/pre-call` and `/refund-policy`.

**Why:** stronger, more concrete positioning and dedicated conversion surfaces for
in-person/QR traffic. These are LIVE on `main` (an earlier SITE.md draft described
them as "not yet live" — that was stale and has been corrected).

## topic: leaderboard-trigger — _2026-06_

The `/campaigns/leaderboard` snapshot is built by an Apps Script on its **own**
time-driven trigger (06:30 daily), fully decoupled from the existing `syncActive()`
digest — installed as a separate trigger, not added inside `syncActive()`.

**Why:** a leaderboard failure must not be able to take down the daily Slack/Discord
campaign digest. Independent triggers isolate the blast radius. Sideshift API keys
stay in Apps Script; Vercel only knows the Web App URL + page password.

## topic: canonical-domain — _2026-04_

Made **non-www** (`vocreations.com`) the canonical/primary domain; `www` now
308-redirects to it (previously reversed, with a 307). Added `middleware.ts` to
enforce the redirect and strip tracking query params (`?wtime=`, `?trakyo_id=`)
that created duplicate URLs. Added Squarespace legacy-URL redirects in
`next.config.mjs`.

**Why:** GSC flagged duplicate-without-canonical and 404 issues from the old
Squarespace site. Full SEO history: [../SEO-WORK-DIARY.md](../SEO-WORK-DIARY.md).

## topic: showcase-video — _(convention)_

Inline showcase `<video>` blocks always use `src={`${v.src}#t=0.1`}` plus
`playsInline muted loop preload="metadata"`, with `onMouseLeave` resetting
`currentTime = 0.1`.

**Why:** the `#t=0.1` media fragment forces iOS Safari to render the frame at 0.1s
as a thumbnail instead of a black box — no separate poster image needed. Reference:
`app/page.tsx`. Keep all raw `<video>` blocks identical.

## topic: content-assets — _2026-06_

Binary/internal assets under `content/` are gitignored (`*.png/jpg/jpeg/webp`
and `content/UGC Trackr/`); only `content/*.md` notes are tracked. The assets
(LinkedIn banners, source QR/photo files, and the "UGC Trackr" brief +
screenshots) live in Google Drive instead.

**Why:** none are referenced by the site (only `public/` is served; the QR/photo
sources are already duplicated under `public/`). Committing ~15MB of unreferenced
binaries would bloat git history permanently. The UGC Trackr brief is for a
separate project (`voc-trackr-internal` → `trackr.vocreations.com`) and, per the
brief itself, should not live in the marketing repo.
